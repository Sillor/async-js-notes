# Introducing workers
Workers provide access to multithreading. Note that workers have access to the same data and can change it independently, which can cause hard to find bugs. To avoid that, you should not give workers direct access to data.

There are three types of workers:
- dedicated workers
- shared workers
- service workers

## Using web workers
main.js:
```js
// Create a new worker, giving it the code in "generate.js"
const worker = new Worker("./generate.js");

// When the user clicks "Generate primes", send a message to the worker.
// The message command is "generate", and the message also contains "quota",
// which is the number of primes to generate.
document.querySelector("#generate").addEventListener("click", () => {
  const quota = document.querySelector("#quota").value;
  worker.postMessage({
    command: "generate",
    quota,
  });
});

// When the worker sends a message back to the main thread,
// update the output box with a message for the user, including the number of
// primes that were generated, taken from the message data.
worker.addEventListener("message", (message) => {
  document.querySelector("#output").textContent =
    `Finished generating ${message.data} primes!`;
});

document.querySelector("#reload").addEventListener("click", () => {
  document.querySelector("#user-input").value =
    'Try typing in here immediately after pressing "Generate primes"';
  document.location.reload();
});
```

generate.js:
```js
// Listen for messages from the main thread.
// If the message command is "generate", call `generatePrimes()`
addEventListener("message", (message) => {
  if (message.data.command === "generate") {
    generatePrimes(message.data.quota);
  }
});

// Generate primes (very inefficiently)
function generatePrimes(quota) {
  function isPrime(n) {
    for (let c = 2; c <= Math.sqrt(n); ++c) {
      if (n % c === 0) {
        return false;
      }
    }
    return true;
  }

  const primes = [];
  const maximum = 1000000;

  while (primes.length < quota) {
    const candidate = Math.floor(Math.random() * (maximum + 1));
    if (isPrime(candidate)) {
      primes.push(candidate);
    }
  }

  // When we have finished, send a message to the main thread,
  // including the number of primes we generated.
  postMessage(primes.length);
}
```
## Other types of workers
The worker from the example above is called a _dedicated worker_. This means it's used by a single script instance.

There are also other types of workers:
- **Shared workers** can be shared by several different scripts running in different windows.
- **Service workers** act like proxy servers, caching resources so that web applications can work when the user is offline. They're a key component of Progressive Web Apps.
